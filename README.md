# burger

A burger logger application with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

## How to use app

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Tech:

- [node.js]
- [express.js]
- [MySQL]
- [express-handlebars.js]

I think the biggest technical challenge was to write an ORM from scratch.
